""" here we have our code to scrape the number and name of the pokemon from the pokemon.com website to put into our
search page later. We use the request.get here and put in the web link we are wanting to scrape the info from and then do
the beautifulSoup below and pass in the page content and have it sent back through html.parser and then we make 2 empty
lists that we will use further down to get the final info we want later. We then do a for loop to find all the 'li' tags
in the web link above and then wek ask to get the text from those and to strip them to a string and then we say if the 
length of the text is what we want to return the info and we append the info below and then we make a var to get the info
we want and pass in an example of what we want returned and then we do a while loop to get our final output and we get 
that by putting the name and number of the pokemon we get from our pokemon list into a var and then we append the var
and add 1 each time we run the while loop until we get to the final number and each time it runs it will get the pokemon
name and number assosiated with it and give it back to us and then we pass the final list into our context and have it
returned with our search.html page and then we will run the list in the search.html page to display the info we got from 
here."""
