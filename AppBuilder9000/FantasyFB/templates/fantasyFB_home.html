        <p class="img-text">Wouldn't you like to see an EPIC match between the heroes of Marvel and DC in a good 'ole NFL Game on Monday night? Well look no further!
        This app that I've created includes the roster that I believe both teams would use to give themselves the best chance to win!
        You don't agree? Well then go ahead and add in some heroes that you think are more deserving! May the better franchise win!</p>
