                This app utilizes the Django Framework. The "Add Players" page allows users
                to create a "Player" and a few stats about that "Player." The "Stats" page
                displays all "Players" created using the form from the "Add Players" page.
                "Standings" shows the NBA standings for specific years, including the current
                season. "History" displays a list of previous NBA Champions, who they defeated,
                and who won the Finals MVP.
